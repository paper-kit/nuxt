Usage
#description
Using Paper-UI components is straightforward. Here's how to use a sample component in your project:

Open a page, e.g., `pages/index.vue`

Import and use a Paper-UI component:
::

::code-box{header="app.vue" type="nuxt" copy=""}

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <PUTabs :tabs="tabs">
      <template #tab="{ tab, isActive }">
        <span :class="{ 'font-bold': isActive }">
          {{ tab.label }}
        </span>
      </template>

      <template #content="{ tab }">
        <p>{{ tab.content }}</p>
      </template>
    </PUTabs>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const tabs = [
  { label: "Tab 1", content: "This is the content for Tab 1." },
  { label: "Tab 2", content: "This is the content for Tab 2." },
  { label: "Tab 3", content: "This is the content for Tab 3." },
];
</script>
